# Build BookshelfNG from Source

BookshelfNG is the Readarr-compatible backend that SeerrNG uses for ebook and
audiobook requests. It is a separate project from SeerrNG. This guide builds
BookshelfNG directly on a Linux host, without Docker, and then connects the
result to SeerrNG.

For SeerrNG itself, use the [SeerrNG source-build
guide](/getting-started/buildfromsource) instead.

:::warning

Source builds follow the BookshelfNG `main` branch and are intended for
operators who are comfortable maintaining a local service. The published
`hardcover` and `softcover` image tags follow the same released `main` line.
Use a pinned BookshelfNG commit or image digest when you need a reproducible
upgrade path.

:::

## What this builds

The BookshelfNG repository contains a .NET backend and a React/Webpack
frontend. A backend-only publish and the frontend output are separate; the
`--packages` option assembles both into the directory you install:

```text
_output/net10.0/linux-x64/publish/Readarr
_output/UI/index.html
_artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/Readarr
_artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/UI/index.html
```

The executable keeps the inherited `Readarr` name. That is expected for the
BookshelfNG fork and does not mean that the wrong project was built.

## Prerequisites

Install these tools on the host that will run BookshelfNG:

- Git
- .NET SDK 10.0.401, not only the .NET runtime
- Node.js 20.x
- Yarn Classic 1.22.x
- Bash, `curl`, and a C/C++ build toolchain for any native Node dependencies

The current repository pins .NET `10.0.401` and Node `20.19.4` in `mise.toml`,
and its build instructions use Yarn Classic `1.22.19`. If you use
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), run `mise install` from the BookshelfNG
checkout. Otherwise install equivalent versions through your operating system
or the upstream tool installers.

Check the active versions before starting:

```bash
dotnet --list-sdks | grep '^10\.'
node --version
yarn --version
```

If Yarn is missing or the wrong major version is active:

```bash
npm install --global yarn@1.22.19
```

## Clone the source

The maintained public fork is [snapetech/bookshelfng](https://github.com/snapetech/bookshelfng).
The supported source-build branch is `main`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone --branch main https://github.com/snapetech/bookshelfng.git
cd bookshelfng
```

For a reproducible build, replace the branch checkout with a reviewed commit:

```bash
git fetch --tags origin
git checkout <reviewed-commit-or-tag>
```

Do not put the BookshelfNG checkout inside SeerrNG's repository or reuse
SeerrNG's `config` directory. Keep the source and runtime data separate.

## Build a Linux x64 binary

For a normal Linux x64 host, build and package the backend and UI together:

```bash
./build.sh --backend --frontend --packages -r linux-x64 -f net10.0
```

If NuGet reports an advisory while restoring, pass an explicit MSBuild warning
policy through the wrapper. Keep the warning visible while investigating it:

```bash
./build.sh --backend --frontend --packages -r linux-x64 -f net10.0 \
  --msbuild-arg "-p:WarningsNotAsErrors=NU1903"
```

Replace `NU1903` with the warning code from the restore output. `build.sh`
rejects unknown options, so flags such as `--no-warn` are not silently ignored.
Do not suppress an advisory instead of updating a vulnerable package.

The command restores .NET and Yarn dependencies, publishes the backend,
builds the frontend, and combines both into a standalone app directory.
Validate both the build output and the installable package:

```bash
test -x _output/net10.0/linux-x64/publish/Readarr
test -s _output/UI/index.html
test -x _artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/Readarr
test -s _artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/UI/index.html
```

Install from `_artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/`. Do not install by
copying only `_output/net10.0/linux-x64/publish/`; that directory contains the
backend but not the separately built web interface. Older guides may say
`net6.0`; this source tree targets `net10.0`.

To build every configured runtime for a Docker build or development checkout,
omit `-r` and `-f`:

```bash
./build.sh --backend --frontend
```

This produces backend outputs for `linux-x64`, `linux-musl-x64`, and
`linux-musl-arm64`, plus `_output/UI`; it does not create the standalone app
directory. Use the Linux x64 package command above when installing directly on
a standard glibc host. A musl build is generally intended for an Alpine-style
environment. Do not copy a musl binary onto a glibc host unless you have
verified that host's compatibility.

## Run it in the foreground first

Run one instance with an explicit data directory before creating a service.
This keeps the generated database, `config.xml`, logs, and encryption keys out
of the source checkout:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/bookshelfng"

./_artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/Readarr \
  -data="$HOME/.config/bookshelfng" \
  -nobrowser
```

The default HTTP port is `8787`. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` from the host,
complete the BookshelfNG setup, and stop the foreground process with
`Ctrl-C` when it is ready to be managed by systemd.

Do not expose the default HTTP listener directly to the public internet. Use a
firewall and an HTTPS reverse proxy, or configure BookshelfNG's own HTTPS
settings before allowing remote access.

## Configure Hardcover or softcover metadata

Choose the metadata mode deliberately. A new installation should normally use
native Hardcover metadata:

```env
HARDCOVER=true
HARDCOVER_NATIVE=true
HARDCOVER_AUTH=Bearer replace-with-your-hardcover-token
```

`HARDCOVER_API_KEY` can be used as the alternative token variable. The token
must be supplied at runtime; do not commit it to the checkout or put it in a
public service unit.

For an existing Readarr-compatible database that still uses Goodreads or
softcover IDs, keep the softcover-compatible path instead. Do not switch an
existing database to Hardcover by changing only the binary, image tag, or
`METADATA_URL`: provider-specific author, book, and edition IDs are not
portable. Use the [Hardcover migration runbook](./bookshelf-hardcover-migration.md)
before changing metadata providers.

## Install as a systemd service

The following example runs the built binary as an unprivileged service user.
Adjust paths to match the host, and stop the service before replacing its
installed files during an upgrade.

Create the user and directories:

```bash
id bookshelfng >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
  sudo useradd --system --user-group --home-dir /var/lib/bookshelfng --create-home \
    --shell /usr/sbin/nologin bookshelfng

sudo install -d -m 0755 /opt/bookshelfng
sudo install -d -o bookshelfng -g bookshelfng -m 0750 /var/lib/bookshelfng
sudo install -d -o root -g bookshelfng -m 0750 /etc/bookshelfng
sudo cp -a _artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/. /opt/bookshelfng/
sudo chown -R root:root /opt/bookshelfng
```

Create `/etc/bookshelfng/bookshelfng.env` with `sudoedit`:

```env
HARDCOVER=true
HARDCOVER_NATIVE=true
HARDCOVER_AUTH="Bearer replace-with-your-hardcover-token"
```

Keep that file readable only by root and the service group:

```bash
sudo chown root:bookshelfng /etc/bookshelfng/bookshelfng.env
sudo chmod 0640 /etc/bookshelfng/bookshelfng.env
```

Create `/etc/systemd/system/bookshelfng.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=BookshelfNG
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=bookshelfng
Group=bookshelfng
WorkingDirectory=/opt/bookshelfng
EnvironmentFile=/etc/bookshelfng/bookshelfng.env
ExecStart=/opt/bookshelfng/Readarr -data=/var/lib/bookshelfng -nobrowser
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable it and inspect the first startup:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now bookshelfng
sudo systemctl status bookshelfng
sudo journalctl -u bookshelfng -n 100 --no-pager
```

The service should answer on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. If SeerrNG runs on the
same host, use that address in the service settings. If it runs on another
host, bind and firewall the listener intentionally instead of assuming that
`127.0.0.1` is reachable remotely.

## One instance for ebooks and audiobooks

One BookshelfNG process and database can manage ebook and audiobook files on
the same book record. The source-build service on port `8787` is enough for
both formats; configure its author root folder, download clients, and profiles
in BookshelfNG.

SeerrNG uses separate routing entries for ebook and audiobook requests. Add
two **Bookshelf** service entries with the same host, port, and API key, then
set **Book Format** to **Book** on one and **Audiobook** on the other. Mark one
entry as the default for each format. Both entries can point to
`http://127.0.0.1:8787` when SeerrNG and BookshelfNG share a host.

Each author can optionally set separate ebook and audiobook folders in
BookshelfNG. Those overrides apply to future imports, upgrades, and renames;
existing files are not moved automatically. Quality and metadata profiles remain
shared. Separate app instances remain an option when isolated databases or
different settings for the same author are required; they are not needed to
support both formats.

## Connect it to SeerrNG

After BookshelfNG is running:

1. Open **Settings > Services** in SeerrNG.
2. Add a **Bookshelf** service.
3. Set the host and port, for example `http://127.0.0.1:8787` for a
   same-host service.
4. Enter the API key shown in BookshelfNG.
5. Leave **URL Base** blank unless you configured one in BookshelfNG.
6. Select **Ebook** or **Audiobook** for the service.
7. Select the root folder, quality profile, and metadata profile returned by
   the connection test.
8. Enable **Scan** and, if desired, **Automatic Search**, then save.

For a direct source install, SeerrNG does not need to know that BookshelfNG was
built locally. It uses the same Readarr-compatible API as the published image.

## Upgrade a source build

Back up each BookshelfNG data directory before upgrading. Then rebuild and
replace the installed files:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop bookshelfng
sudo tar -C /var/lib -czf \
  "$HOME/bookshelfng-data-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tgz" bookshelfng

cd ~/src/bookshelfng
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
./build.sh --backend --frontend --packages -r linux-x64 -f net10.0

sudo cp -a _artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/. /opt/bookshelfng/
sudo systemctl start bookshelfng
sudo journalctl -u bookshelfng -n 100 --no-pager
```

Keep the previous binary and data backup until ebook, audiobook, and
both-format requests have been tested through SeerrNG. If you are changing
from softcover metadata to Hardcover, follow the migration runbook instead of
treating this as a normal binary upgrade.

## Troubleshooting

### `dotnet` cannot find a compatible SDK

Install the .NET 10 SDK. A runtime alone is not sufficient to restore and
publish this source tree.

### NuGet reports a vulnerable package

First update the checkout to the latest BookshelfNG `main` commit and confirm
the resolved package version. The maintained release line pins patched MailKit
and other security-sensitive transitive packages. If an audit warning still
blocks a source build, use the supported `--msbuild-arg` forwarding option with
`WarningsNotAsErrors` while the dependency is reviewed; use `NoWarn` only when
you have deliberately accepted that audit policy.

### The UI is missing

Build and install the combined standalone package from the same checkout:

```bash
./build.sh --backend --frontend --packages --runtime linux-x64 --framework net10.0
test -s _artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/UI/index.html
sudo cp -a _artifacts/linux-x64/net10.0/Readarr/. /opt/bookshelfng/
```

The installed web interface is at `/opt/bookshelfng/UI`. Building only the
backend, or copying only its `_output/.../publish` directory, omits that UI.

### The service exits immediately

Check the service log and the data-directory permissions:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u bookshelfng -n 200 --no-pager
sudo -u bookshelfng test -w /var/lib/bookshelfng
```

The service user must be able to write the database, `config.xml`, logs, and
data-protection keys.

### The second instance cannot start

Confirm that it has a different `-data` directory and that its `config.xml`
uses port `8788` rather than the default `8787`:

```bash
ss -ltnp | grep -E ':8787|:8788'
```

### Hardcover searches are empty

For native Hardcover mode, confirm that `HARDCOVER=true`, native mode is
enabled, and `HARDCOVER_AUTH` includes the `Bearer ` prefix. For compatibility
mode, verify the configured `METADATA_URL` and the proxy logs. A successful TCP
connection does not prove that metadata lookup is configured correctly.
